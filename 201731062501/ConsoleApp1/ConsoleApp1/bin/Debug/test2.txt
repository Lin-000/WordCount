Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away .
And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall .
there with a sign .
O Troupe of little vagrants of the world , leave your footprints in my words .
The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover .
It becomes small as one song , as one kiss of the eternal .
